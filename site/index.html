        <p class="lead">Killcord is a tool used to build resilient deadman's switches for releasing encrypted payloads. Leveraging the blockchain and a p2p filesystem, the killcord project owner hides a secret key from the world by <strong>checking in</strong> to the killcord smart contract on ethereum. If the owner stops checking in after a period of time, the killcord is triggered and the secret key that decrypts an encrypted payload is published.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">The easiest way to get started with killcord is by <strong>watching</strong> an existing project and decrypting its payload. You'll need to install the <code>killcord</code> <strong>command line tool</strong>. You can download the binary here:

    	<small>There are more installation options listed in the <a href="https://github.com/nomasters/killcord">README</a></small>

      <p class="lead">
      Unzip the file and move it into your <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> directory
      </p>
      <pre>mv killcord /usr/local/bin/killcord</pre>
      <small>You may need to use <code>sudo</code> or change the ownership of <code>/usr/local/</code> to your user account</small>

    	<p class="lead">
    	Make a new project directory and change into it:
    	</p>
    	<pre>mkdir demo-watcher && cd demo-watcher</pre>
        <p class="lead">
    	Its time to setup a watcher project, the hash after the watch command is the address of the killcord smart contract that you'll be watching on ethereum.
    	</p>
    	<pre>killcord watch 0x53cacca6fac1499eac058017027769de630ba65e</pre>
        <p class="lead">
    	Your project has a copy of the encrypted payload in the <code>payload/encrypted</code> directory. This contract already has a published secret key that's been written to the <code>killcord.toml</code> file in this project. Now you can decrypt the payload by running:
    	</p>
    	<pre>killcord decrypt</pre>
        <p class="lead">
    	Congratulations. You've successfully decrypted your first killcord payload. You will find the contents in <code>payload/decrypted</code> in the project folder. With just 4 commands, you've installed a new piece of software, created a project folder, started watching a killcord project, and even decrypted the payload. Not too shabby.
    	</p>

    	<p class="lead">
    	If you'd like to learn more about killcord, get instructions for testing out your first <code>owner</code> project, or want to give some feedback,
